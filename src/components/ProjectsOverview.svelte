        I wanted to watch the whole IMDB Top 250. So I wrote an app to track my
        progress. It uses GraphQL + Typescript + Prisma for the backend and
        Apollo + React for the frontend. I have used ID based authentication for
        the lists, so users don't have to login. Just need to remember the URL.

        Created a script to enchance my gaming experience. Script takes the
        average RGB of the screen and puts it into a difference mechanism.
        According to delta, it changes the colors of the lights to enrich the
        experience. Read about it on my blog <a
